Todoey: -A simple Todolist app which is made on iOS13 and uses Realm as the backend database for storing the data and retrieving it back to our app. It also uses some pods such as Chameleon for the front end part and SwipeCellKit pod which is used for developing the swipe functionality for deletion of a particular task and lastly I used IQKeyboard manager so that to make my keyboard more responsive with less codes.
